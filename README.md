I've been learning programming for about 6 months now.

I have a solid grasp of html, CSS, and javascript, though I feel far from an expert at this time. 

My educational background is in Literature, History, and Education. 6 months ago I didn't even now what html was lol. 

I am interested in games, trivia, web development, and apps.
