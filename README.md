I love building fullstack projects with Node, Express, React, and Tailwind ‚ù§Ô∏è

My educational background is in Literature, History, and Education. For about 10 years I was an English, History, and Literature teacher in China. 
When I came home to care for my grandmother for a while, I decided to start a new learning journey and discovered programming. 

I am interested in games, trivia, web development, and apps.
